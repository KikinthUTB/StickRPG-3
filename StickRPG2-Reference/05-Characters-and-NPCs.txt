## Notes for Stick RPG 3
*   **Humor:** The NPCs are essentially walking jokes. Stick RPG 3 needs to update the humor for the modern era (2020s memes?) while keeping the charm.
*   **Interactivity:** Most NPCs are simple "Quest Givers" or "Punching Bags". SR3 could add relationship meters or extensive dialogue trees.
