# Stick RPG 2 - Gameplay Mechanics

## The Core Loop
1.  **Time Management:** The day is divided into Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night. Actions (Working, Training, Sleeping) consume time units.
2.  **Stat Grinding:** Train stats -> Get better Job -> Get Money -> Buy better items -> Repeat.
3.  **Exploration:** Unlock new islands to access better amenities.

## The Time System (Detailed)
*   **Flow:** Time moves only when you perform an action (Work, Sleep) or travel. It doesn't usually tick in real-time if you stand still (Turn-based feel in real-time wrapper).
*   **Day/Night Cycle:**
    *   **Morning (6AM - 12PM):** Best for School/Jobs.
    *   **afternoon (12PM - 6PM):** Jobs/Shopping.
    *   **Evening (6PM - 12AM):** Bar/Club/Illegal Jobs open.
    *   **Night/Late (12AM - 6AM):** Most shops close. Dangerous NPCs come out. Energy drains faster.
*   **Sleep:** You MUST sleep to reset Energy.
    *   **Penalty:** If you don't sleep, you pass out (Teleport to hospital/home, lose money, lose next day's time).
    *   **Bed Quality:** Better beds = Less time needed to sleep = More time to be active.

## The Stats (S.P.E.C.I.A.L... sort of)
*   **Strength (STR):**
    *   **Use:** Combat damage, Job requirements (Police, Lumberjack).
    *   **Training:** Gym (Clicking minigame), Fighting Gangsters.
*   **Intelligence (INT):**
    *   **Use:** Job requirements (Hacker, Scientist), Winning Chess.
    *   **Training:** University (Math/Puzzle minigames), Studying.
*   **Charm (CHM):**
    *   **Use:** Job requirements (Pimp, Politician), Lowering prices (bartering).
    *   **Training:** Drinking at the Bar, Smoking (decreases Health), Working specific jobs.
*   **Karma:**
    *   **Range:** -1000 to +1000.
    *   **Effect:** Unlocks specific job paths (Positive vs Negative).
    *   **Modifying:** Doing good/bad deeds, yielding/stealing.

## Combat System
*   **Style:** Real-time "Beat 'em up" / Shooter.
*   **Controls:** WASD to move, Mouse to aim/attack.
*   **Weapons:** Melee (Bats, Swords) has short range. Guns require Ammo.
*   **Death:** If HP hits 0, you wake up in the Hospital and lose Money/Time.
*   **Strategy:** Kiting (running backward while shooting) is the dominant strategy.

## The Economy & Casino
*   **Gambling:** A major part of the game.
    *   **Slots:** Pure luck.
    *   **Blackjack:** Skill-based.
    *   **Roulette:** High risk.
*   **Exploit:** Players often "Save Scum" (Save before betting, Reload if lost).

## New Game + (NGP)
*   Upon beating the game and entering the Right Portal:
    *   **Keep:** Stats (STR/INT/CHM).
    *   **Lose:** Inventory, Money.
    *   **Goal:** Reach 2000+ Stats to unlock God-tier jobs and items.

## Notes for Stick RPG 3
*   **Minigames:** Training stats in SR2 was often repetitive (clicking). Stick RPG 3 should make training minigames fun or idle-able.
*   **Combat:** Needs a dodge roll or block mechanic. SR2 combat was very "stat check" or "run away".
*   **Time:** The strict time slots can be stressful. SR3 could verify if "Real-time" (Stardew Valley style) is better than "Action-based" time.
