## Key Takeaways from Stick RPG 2

### What Worked Well

#### 1. Stat-Based Progression
- Three clear stats (Strength, Intelligence, Charm) created distinct playstyles
- Stat requirements for jobs and areas provided clear goals
- Multiple ways to increase each stat offered player choice
- Balanced builds vs. specialized builds both viable

#### 2. Progressive Unlocking
- Islands unlocking gradually kept players engaged long-term
- Stat gates created sense of progression and achievement
- Story gates made players feel narrative advancement
- Hidden content rewarded exploration

#### 3. Multiple Playstyles
- Legal vs. illegal paths
- Corporate vs. criminal careers
- Social vs. combat-focused gameplay
- Different stat builds = different experiences

#### 4. Time Management
- Day/night cycle created rhythm and pacing
- Energy system prevented endless grinding
- Schedule planning added strategic element
- Limited time per day made choices meaningful

#### 5. Relationship and Karma Systems
- Moral choices had real consequences
- Relationships made NPCs feel more real
- Multiple romance options with different requirements
- Reputation affected gameplay opportunities

#### 6. Economic Progression
- Clear wealth tiers from broke to ultra-rich
- Multiple income sources (jobs, investments, gambling, crime)
- Meaningful purchases (housing, vehicles, items)
- End-game still had economic challenges

### Areas for Improvement

#### 1. Repetitive Gameplay
**Issue**: Same actions repeated daily
**Potential Solutions**:
- More varied work mini-games
- Random events to break routine

**Potential Solutions**:
- End-game challenges and raids

#### 3. Shallow Combat
**Issue**: Combat became simple stat comparison
**Potential Solutions**:
- More tactical combat system

- Defensive options
- Enemy variety with different tactics
- Skill-based timing elements

#### 4. Limited NPC Depth
**Issue**: NPCs felt static and predictable
**Potential Solutions**:
- NPC daily schedules and routines
- More dynamic dialogue
- NPCs remember past interactions
- NPC-to-NPC relationships
- Evolving NPC storylines

#### 5. Grinding Required
**Issue**: Some progression felt grindy
**Potential Solutions**:
- More efficient training methods unlocked over time
- Diminishing returns on repetitive actions
- Variety in stat-building activities
- Passive progression options
- Milestone-based unlocks

## Design Principles for Stick RPG 3
