# Stick RPG 2 - Main Story and Quest Roadmap

## Core Narrative
The protagonist "The Player" falls from the 3rd Dimension into "Paper Thin City", a 2D world. The main goal is to navigate this strange world, amass power/wealth/karma, and ultimately find a way to return home (or rule this world).

## The Main Quest: Dimensional Objects
The central plot revolves around **Professor Ansel**, a scientist studying dimensional physics. To open the path home (or to power), you must collect three **4D Objects**.

### 1. The 4D Hypercube
**Description:** A cube that exists in 4 dimensions.
**How to Obtain:**
*   **Positive Karma Path:** Defeat **Chess Master Chase** (Yellow Head) at the University. Requires **500+ Intelligence**.
*   **Negative Karma Path:** Bail out the **Nigerian Prince** at the Police Station. Costs **$10,000**.

### 2. The Klein Bottle
**Description:** A bottle with no inside or outside.
**How to Obtain:**
*   **Positive Karma Path:** Buy a **Self-Help Book** ($120 from Wally! Mart) and give it to the **Suicidal Goth Dude** on Island 1.
*   **Negative Karma Path:** Buy **Painkillers** ($85 from Wally! Mart) and give them to the Suicidal Goth Dude.
*   **Alternative (Strength):** Beat **Broski** in an arm-wrestling match at The Club (Nighttime). Requires **500+ Strength**.

### 3. The Mobius Strip
**Description:** A loop with only one side.
**How to Obtain:**
*   **Requirements:** You need **3 Bags of Coca**.
*   **Positive Karma Path:** Turn the Coca in to a Cop at the Police Station.
*   **Negative Karma Path:** Give the Coca to the **Cocaine Cowboy** (a drug dealer NPC).

## The Climax: Professor Ansel's Lab
Once you have all three objects:
1.  Give them to **Professor Ansel** (found in the University/Lab area).
2.  He gives you the **Lab Key**.
3.  Enter the Secret Lab (Island 1, near the start).
4.  **Boss Fight:** Defeat Ansel's henchmen and then **Professor Ansel** himself. He is tough; bring a Minigun or powerful melee weapon and plenty of food/meds.

## The Endings
After defeating Ansel, three portals appear. Your choice determines the ending. Karma does *not* force an ending; it is a player choice.

### 1. Left Portal (The TV Ending)
*   **Outcome:** You return to the 2D world of the original *Stick RPG 1*.
*   **Visual:** The game view zooms out to show the world on an old distortion TV screen.
*   **Lore:** You are back where it all started, but stuck in the past.

### 2. Middle Portal (Main Menu)
*   **Outcome:** The game simply ends and boots you to the Main Menu.
*   **Metaphor:** The "Anti-Ending". You break the game loop essentially by quitting.

### 3. Right Portal (New Game +)
*   **Outcome:** The "True" loop. You restart the game from Day 1.
*   **Retained:** Strength, Intelligence, Charm stats. Trophies.
*   **Reset:** Money, Items, Jobs, Karma (resets to 0).
*   **Purpose:** Allows you to grind for the Director's Cut "God" jobs (Dark Lord/Light Knight) which require massive stats.

## Major Side Storylines

### The Good vs. Evil Bird Hunt
*   **Collect:** 4 Rare **Trophemon** (Birds) scattered around the world (give Ladder to Old Lady, etc.).
*   **Good Choice:** Give to the **Activists**. Reward: **Hoverboard** (Fastest vehicle) + Positive Karma.
*   **Evil Choice:** Give to the **Eccentric Millionaire**. Reward: **$12,000** + Negative Karma.

### The Mystery of the "Other" Island
*   **Construction:** Mike the construction worker is building a new island.
*   **Truth:** It never truly finishes in the base game loop, serving as a perpetual "coming soon" joke or a location for specific mod/cheat access (Z-Island).

## Stick RPG 3 Notes
*   **Key Takeaway:** The "Fetch Quest" structure (3 artifacts) was simple but effective because each artifact had multiple solutions (Combat vs Money vs Smarts).
*   **Improvement:** Stick RPG 2's story was loose. SR3 could verify the "multiple solution" design but add more narrative depth to the antagonists.
