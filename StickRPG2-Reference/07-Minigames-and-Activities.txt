# Stick RPG 2 - Minigames and Activities

## Overview
Gameplay in Stick RPG 2 is broken up by various "Minigames" that handle Stat Progression and Entertainment. This is a key design pillar: **Stats are not gained just by clicking a button, but by playing a game.**

## Gym Minigames (Strength Training)
Instead of just "Working Out," the player plays active minigames.
*   **Bench Press:** A rhythm/timing game. A bar moves up and down, and the player must click when it's in the green zone to lift the weight.
    *   **Success:** Strength Gain.
    *   **Failure:** The bar crushes the stick figure (Health Loss).
*   **Treadmill:** Rapid clicking or button mashing to keep speed up.
*   **Sparring / Boxing:** A simplified version of the main combat. You fight an NPC in a ring.
    *   **Win:** Large Strength gain + Money.
    *   **Lose:** Health loss.

## University Minigames (Intelligence Training)
*   **Classroom:** Often represented by simple math problems or memory tests.
    *   *Example:* "What is 12 x 12?" or a pattern replication game.
*   **Chess:** A simplified AI chess match (or just a "stat check" roll in some versions).
*   **Tutoring:** Passive gain (costing money).

## Casino Minigames (Gambling)
The fastest way to get rich or go broke.
*   **Blackjack:** Standard 21 rules.
*   **Roulette:** Bet on numbers/colors.
*   **Slots:** Pure RNG. Visuals are of various stick rpg items (Sword, Burger, etc.).
*   **Horse/Unicorn Racing:** Bet on a racer. You watch them run across the screen. Pure RNG but exciting.

## Job-Specific Minigames
Some jobs have unique active elements (in Director's Cut or specific versions):
*   **Lumberjack:** A "Chopping" minigame where you must click to saw through the tree while avoiding obstacles or hitting specific zones.
*   **Bartending:** Mixing drinks (Recipe memory).
*   **Hacking:** Typing code or avoiding firewalls in a matrix-style interface.

## Notes for Stick RPG 3
*   **Feedback:** The minigames in SR2 were fun at first but became repetitive grinding tools.
*   **SR3 Idea:** Add "Auto-Complete" or "Skip" options for minigames once the player reaches a certain mastery level, or make the minigames evolve/get harder (and more rewarding) as stats increase.
*   **Cheating:** In SR2, simple games like Math or Trivia were easily cheated. SR3 should focus on **Skill/Reflex** based minigames (like the Bench Press) which are harder to "wiki" your way through.
